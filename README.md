# AFOS-NG
ANDRAX-NG Next Generation Package Manager, Simple but effective!

> AFOS-NG is still under development and should be functional (though not 100% complete) by the time ANDRAX-NG is launched.

AFOS-NG is a package manager specifically designed for installing and managing Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing tools.

Written in C, AFOS-NG has relatively simple code following [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).

It is perfectly aligned with the HARD-BASED and SFB (Simple, Fast, Bullshitless) ANDRAX-NG guidelines.

The ***repository*** directory contains the YAML file that is used by AFOS-NG for package management.

For instructions on how to use AFOS-NG or create a repository for it, see the [documentation](https://snakesecurity.org/andrax-documentation/andrax-afos-ng/)
